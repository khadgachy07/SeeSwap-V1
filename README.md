# SeeSwap: A Next.js App for Analyzing Trade Data from the Uniswap Decentralized Exchange

## Introduction
SeeSwap is a Next.js app for analyzing trade data from the Uniswap decentralized exchange platform. The app uses the Web3.js library to connect to the Ethereum blockchain and fetch trade data in real-time, providing updates to the trade data. SeeSwap is designed to be a powerful tool for traders, researchers, and developers, offering a reliable and easy-to-use interface for accessing and analyzing trade data from the Ethereum blockchain.

## Features
- Real-time updates to trade data using the WebSocket of Alchemy.
- A custom React hook, `useFetchTradeData`, for fetching trade data from the Ethereum blockchain.
- A `TradeData` type for defining the structure of the trade data.
- A `TradeTable` component for displaying the trade data in a table format.

## Technical Details
SeeSwap is a Next.js app built using the following technologies:
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript for better code readability and maintainability.
- Next.js: A framework for building server-side rendered React applications.
- Web3.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- Alchemy WebSocket: A WebSocket provider for connecting to the Ethereum blockchain.

The app is structured as follows:
- TypeScript:
  - The `@types/react` and `@types/react-dom` packages are added to provide TypeScript typings for React.
  - The `trade-data.ts` file defines the `TradeData` type and other types used in the app.
- Next.js:
  - The `pages` directory is used to define the routes of the app.
  - The `index.tsx` file in the `pages` directory is the entry point of the app.
- Web3.js:
  - The Web3 library is used to connect to the Ethereum blockchain.
  - The WebSocket provider of Alchemy is used to listen for real-time updates to the trade data.
